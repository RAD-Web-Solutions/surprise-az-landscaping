                <h2>Creative Hardscape</h2>
                <p>If you’re hoping to add some personality to your home’s exterior, hardscape design is a great place to start. By definition, hardscape refers to the paved or otherwise impermeable surfaces on your property. This can include everything from driveways and sidewalks to patios and decks.</p>
                <p>While softscape features like gardens and trees get all the glory, creative hardscaping can make just as big of an impact. If you are unsure where to begin, here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing.</p>
                <p>Look at the shape of your property. Are there any areas that could benefit from a little extra definition? Curved borders can help break up large expanses of lawn and add interest to an otherwise bland landscape.</p>
                <p>Next, consider the materials you use for your hardscape features.</p>
                <h2>Which type of landscape design is best for you</h2>
                <p>There are a few things to consider when choosing a landscape design. </p>
                <p>First, think about the overall look that you want to achieve. Do you want a relaxed and informal look, or a more polished and formal appearance?</p>
                <p>Second, consider the amount of time along with the effort you are willing to put into maintenance. If you don’t have enough time to out into this project, then a low-maintenance design may be best for you.</p>
                <p>Lastly, think about your budget.</p>
